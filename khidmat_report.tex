% Use first person plural (we, us) even if you did the Khidmat individually.

% An introduction of the project, no more than 2 sentences. Provide the highest level of detail only. Other details will come later.
% Typically, "This project is to <short description of porject> for/at <client>."
This project is to create an Award Management System. Furthermore, we will also be somewhat involved in all other side projects related to IT such as the DYSF Portal and the Scholarship Management System.  

% About the client.
DYSF is a non-profit organization that represents the Dhoraji Memons and the youth of the community. DYSF's mission is to strive for transformation of Dhoraji Memons into a highly educated, self reliant, progressive and healthy community. More On:\newline \href{http://www.dhorajiyouth.org/aboutus.aspx?page=about}{http://www.dhorajiyouth.org/aboutus.aspx?page=about}

% About the project.
DYSF has a an award ceremony every year where hundreds of Dhoraji Memon students from all education background receive awards for their achievements in their studies. However, most of the system relies on manual entry of paper based forms and the use of excel to generate lists which is a highly inefficient system in this technologically advanced era. Our objective is to make an efficient system, that makes use of database technology, which could ease the overall process. Moreover, we would also give our contributions to IT related projects that will be taking place during our khidmat which are: The DYSF Portal and the DYSF Scholarship Management System. All the work will be done by the DYSF IT Team, which includes us.

% About the plan of work.
We will work part time for DYSF under the supervision of their IT supervisor, who is one of their board of governors. Our main work would take place at our own convenient time and place and their is no particular deadline set for the project. The goal is to develop, test, and deploy the award management system by the end of our Khidmat.

\section*{Conclusion}

% Remind the reader about the project. Summarise your activities over the course of the project.
Our project was to build an Award Management System for Dhoraji Youth Service Foundation. We started by meeting the external supervisor and IT team to discuss how to build this system. Initially, we decided to make both the user-end and admin-end of the system. However, due to some reasons our IT team advised us to only focus on the admin-end. We then identified the necessary tools to build the required system and trained ourselves on them. The system was built on PHP Laravel using Eloquent ORM to work with our Database. Development and testing were carried out in collaboration with the IT team head so that any shortcomings were identified and catered to as we went along. After development, we gave the system to the IT team head and also gave the demo to the external supervisor and all those involved from the administration. The deployment responsibility has been undertaken by the IT team head and the external supervisor; as they ensured us that they are going to deploy the system as soon as they get the hosting for it. We also attended meetings and gave a hand in other IT projects that were going on during our time there.
