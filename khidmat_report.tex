This project is to revamp the IT system of Dhoraji Youth Service Foundation. Our main objective is to create an Award Management System; furthermore, we will be involved in all other side projects related to IT such as the DYSF Portal and the Scholarship Management System.  

% About the client.

% About the project.
DYSF has a an award ceremony every year where hundreds of dhoraji memon students from all education background receive awards for their achievements in their studies. However, most of the system relies on manual entry of paper based forms and the use of excel to generate lists which is a highly inefficient system in this technologically advanced era. Our objective is to make an efficient system, that makes use of database technology, which could ease the overall process. Moreover, we would also give our contributions to IT related projects that will be taking place during our khidmat which are: The DYSF Portal and the DYSF Scholarship Management System. All the work will be done by the DYSF IT Team, which includes us.

% About the plan of work.
We will work part time for DYSF under the supervision of their IT supervisor, who is one of their board of governors. Our main work would take place at our own convenient time and place and their is no particular deadline set for the project. The goal is to develop, test, and deploy the award management system by the end of our Khidmat.

We spent this week meeting the IT team we would work with. We laid down objectives and aims and also decided on the division of labour.
